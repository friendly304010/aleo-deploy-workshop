### Build & Test our Program

Let's make sure that our program is working by running the following commands:

1. Does it build? `leo build`
   `Leo âœ… Compiled 'main.leo' into Aleo instructions`
2. Can we mint tokens? `leo run mint`
   
   My output:

3. Can we transfer tokens? `leo run transfer`

You can see here, one account now has 90 tokens and the other has 10, meaning we succesfully transfered 10 tokens.
